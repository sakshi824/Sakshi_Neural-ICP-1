Write a python program for the following: – Input the string “Python” as a list of characters from console, delete at least 2 characters, reverse the resultant string and print it. Sample input: •python •Sample output: •ntyp SOLUTION: * In this program the user enters the sentance which is include with python word * Converting string to lowercase by using lower() function * Then used a "replace" function inorder to replace the "python" with "pythons" and stored it in string variable. * Then displayed the sentance after the replacement with pythons... OUTPUT:image Enter the sentance I love python and I work on PYTHON The sentance after replacing i love pythons and i work on pythons
– Take two numbers from user and perform at least 4 arithmetic operations on them.

SOLUTION: * Getting two integers from user inorder to perform the arithmetic operations * Performed addition, substractio, multiplication, division and then displayed those values OUTPUT: image Enter 1st integer5 Enter 2nd integer2 The addition of 2 values is 7 The multiplication of 2 values is 10 The substraction of 2 values is 3 The division of 2 values is 2.5

Write a program that accepts a sentence and replace each occurrence of ‘python’ with ‘pythons’. •Sample input: •I love playing with python •Sample output: •I love playing with pythons
SOLUTION: * Getting a word as input from user * Then deleting 2 characters from a word using : * Then reversing the resultant string by using the slice operator * Then displaying the final reversed string OUTPUT: image Enter string goodday The reversed string after removal of 2 characters ddoog

Use the if statement conditions to write a program to print the letter grade based on an input class score. Use the grading scheme we are using in this class.
SOLUTION: * Getting an percentage from user. * Based on percentage calculating the grade * If grade is greater than or equals to 90 and less than or equals to 100 then grade is A * If grade is greater than or equals to 80 and less than 90 then grade is B * If grade is greater than or equals to 70 and less than 80 then grade is C * If grade is greater than or equals to 60 and less than 70 then grade is D * If grade is greater than or equals to 0 and less than 60 then grade is F OUTPUT: image Enter your percentage59.5 Your grade is F PS C:\Users\pothu\OneDrive\Documents\Divya> & "C:/Program Files/Python311/python.exe" c:/Users/pothu/OneDrive/Documents/Divya/grades.py Enter your percentage80 Your grade is B PS C:\Users\pothu\OneDrive\Documents\Divya> & "C:/Program Files/Python311/python.exe" c:/Users/pothu/OneDrive/Documents/Divya/grades.py Enter your percentage71.2 Your grade is C
